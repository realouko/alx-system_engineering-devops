STEP 1: GIT CLONE
Enter git clone command followed by GIT URL:

This was done after I had created a new repository
called alx-system_engineerinf-devops on github

I then used the vim text editor to create a README.md file and edit it

I then created a new directory called 0x01-shell_basics using the mkdir 0x01-shell_basics  command

I then used the cd 0x01-shell_basicss command to change the working directory

Inside the 0x01-shell_basics directory, I used the vim editor to create a new file

After editing the file on vim, I saved it using the :wq command
