STEP 1: GIT CLONE
Enter git clone command followed by GIT URL:

This was done after I had created a new repository
called alx-system_engineerinf-devops on github

I then used the vim text editor to create a README.md file and edit it

I then created a new directory called 0x02-shell_redirections using the mkdir 0x02-shell_redirections  command

I then used the cd 0x02-shell_redirections command to change the working directory

Inside the 0x02-shell_redirections directory, I used the vim editor to create a new file
called 0-hello_world using the command vim 0-hello_world

After editing the file on vim, I saved it using the :wq command

I then typed the command chmod +x 0-hello-world to make it executable
